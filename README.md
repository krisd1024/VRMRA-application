# VRMRA-application
Users can download the .apk file from the Builds folder on the GitHub repository and use Meta Quest Developer Hub or a similar application to install the file onto a Meta Quest 2 headset. The headset should have developer mode enabled in order to install the application. The VRMRA application saves answers in a comma separated values (CSV) file on the headset at the end of the assessment, which can be retrieved by connecting the headset to a computer after each administration.
